# Decentralized Commercial Elevator Maintenance

A blockchain-based platform for transparent, secure, and compliant elevator maintenance management.

## Overview

The Decentralized Commercial Elevator Maintenance platform leverages blockchain technology to revolutionize how commercial elevator systems are registered, inspected, serviced, and monitored for compliance. This solution creates an immutable record of elevator history, inspection schedules, technician qualifications, and regulatory complianceâ€”driving accountability and safety across the entire maintenance lifecycle.

## Core Smart Contracts
